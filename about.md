I joined Carnegie Mellon University as a  Ph.D. student in 2019 after receiving my B.S. in Physics and in Computer Science with highest honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I am a second-year PhD student co-advised by Professor Bob Iannucci and Professor Carlee Joe-Wong of the CMU Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department.

My graduate research is focussed on applications enabled by LPWAN (Low-Power Large-Area Network) technologies, especially sensor networks and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. My research vision is to develop IoT systems that automatically decomposes a macro-program into pieces to run over the network in an **energy-aware** way. I’m very excited by the potential of bringing IoT programming to specialists and non-specialists alike after the IoT system can decompose the application programs and manage the resource by itself.


I also have some experience designing low-power hardware for IoT applications and working with LoRa network. I write a LoRaWAN network simulator based on earlier work (LoRaSim, FREE, etc. ).

I’m also excited by all kinds of other things, especially related to applied math and theoretical physics, and a combination of the two.

My hobby is drawing.
