I joined Carnegie Mellon University as a  Ph.D. student in 2019 after receiving my B.S. in Physics and Computer Science with highest honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student co-advised by Professor Bob Iannucci and Professor Carlee Joe-Wong of the CMU Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department.

My graduate research focuses on applications enabled by LPWAN (Low-Power Large-Area Network) technologies, especially sensor networks and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. My research vision is to develop IoT systems that automatically decomposes a macro-program into pieces to run over the network in an **energy-aware** way. Iâ€™m very excited by the potential of bringing IoT programming to specialists and non-specialists alike.

I also gained some experience designing low-power hardware for IoT applications and working with the LoRa network. I wrote a LoRaWAN network simulator based on earlier work (LoRaSim, FREE, etc. ).

In addition to my graduate study, I have a broad interest in different fields. I have been interested in theoretical physics since young. I studied physics and investigated quantum field theory during my undergrad years. I am also interested in applied mathematics with the applications of partial differential equations (PDEs) for system modeling and designing in general. It was a big decision to switch to engineering for my graduate study, which is more applied and practical.   

Because of my mixed backgrounds, I  find it easy to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplinary boundaries. I am excited to see what difference I can make to the engineering field with my math and physics background, and what new technologies/methodologies I learned from engineering can benefit physics research.

I love drawing, by the way :)
