I joined Carnegie Mellon University as a  Ph.D. student in 2019 after receiving my B.S. in Physics and in Computer Science with highest honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My graduate research is focussed on applications of low power wide area networks (LPWANs), especially sensor networks and their application in the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). program decomposition for IoT systems and intelligent edge computing.

Broadly speaking, Iâ€™m excited by all things related to applied mathematics, and theoretical physics.
