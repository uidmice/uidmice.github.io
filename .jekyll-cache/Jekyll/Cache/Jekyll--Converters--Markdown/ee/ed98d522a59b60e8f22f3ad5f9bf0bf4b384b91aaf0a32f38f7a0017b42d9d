RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley | NASA Research Park, CA  		                Aug. 2019 - present
Doctoral Research: Energy-aware edge resource management and program abstraction for multi-tenant IoT systems
	Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
	Advisors: Bob Iannucci, Carlee Joe-Wong
Extend the dataflow graph to capture hardware, software and timing constraints for IoT programs, and use the representation to develop an optimization framework for distributed multi-tenant IoT systems that enables system-level joint workload optimization and coordination across applications
Research: Intelligent communication for disaster response
	Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
	Advisors: Bob Iannucci, Carlee Joe-Wong
Design algorithms to coordinate device transmission in an emergency scenario that optimize the energy usage
Implement a simulator to evaluate the designed algorithms by testing and benchmark comparison
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill | Chapel Hill, NC                      Aug. 2015 - May 2019
Honors Thesis: Unsupervised learning for quantum physics with Monte Carlo simulation
	UNC Department of Physics
	Advisors: JoaquÃ­n E Drut
Researched on leveraging dimension reduction techniques to extract phases and phase transitions directly from the Monte Carlo simulation of many-body configurations of a physical system
Honors Thesis: System design of a spiking-based asynchronous frameless imaging architecture
	UNC Department of Computer Science
	Advisors: Montek Singh
Designed and developed the architecture of an image sensor whose output is continuous stream of asynchronous pixel updates, with improvements on the dynamic range, color sensitivity and granularity of gradations of the camera
Evaluated and analyzed various design trade-offs (circuit size and speed) via Verilog behavioral simulation and SPICE electrical simulation
Research: Non-lineal non-local cross-diffusion model under constraints
	UNC Department of Mathematics
	Advisor: Nancy RodrÃ­guez
Formalized a nonlinear nonlocal cross-diffusion model that captured the behavioral patterns of biological groups subject to self-interactions (intra-species) and cross-interactions (inter-species), and the effect of environmental constraints
Created a simulator that implemented a numeric finite-volume scheme with a gradient flow structure to simulate the multi-group dynamics, and implemented the scheme under both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases utilizing MATLAB
