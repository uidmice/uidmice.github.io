## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Carnegie Mellon University
*Aug. 2019 - present*

* __Doctoral Research__: Energy-aware edge resource management and program abstraction for multi-tenant IoT systems

	Advisors: Bob Iannucci, Carlee Joe-Wong

	Extend the dataflow graph to capture hardware, software and timing constraints for IoT programs, and use the representation to develop an optimization framework for distributed multi-tenant IoT systems that enables system-level joint workload optimization and coordination across applications.


* __Research__: Intelligent communication for disaster response

	Advisors: Bob Iannucci, Carlee Joe-Wong

	Design algorithms to coordinate device transmission in an emergency scenario that optimize the energy usage;

	Implement a simulator to evaluate the designed algorithms by testing and benchmark comparison.

### University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
*Aug. 2015 - May 2019*

* __Honors Thesis__: Unsupervised learning for quantum physics with Monte Carlo simulation

	_Advisors: Joaquín E Drut_

	Researched on leveraging dimension reduction techniques to extract phases and phase transitions directly from the Monte Carlo simulation of many-body configurations of a physical system.

* __Honors Thesis__: System design of a spiking-based asynchronous frameless imaging architecture

	_Advisors: Montek Singh_

	Designed and developed the architecture of an image sensor whose output is continuous stream of asynchronous pixel updates, with improvements on the dynamic range, color sensitivity and granularity of gradations of the camera;

	Evaluated and analyzed various design trade-offs (circuit size and speed) via Verilog behavioral simulation and SPICE electrical simulation.

* __Research__: Non-lineal non-local cross-diffusion model under constraints

	_Advisor: Nancy Rodríguez_

	Formalized a nonlinear nonlocal cross-diffusion model that captured the behavioral patterns of biological groups subject to self-interactions (intra-species) and cross-interactions (inter-species), and the effect of environmental constraints;

	Created a simulator that implemented a numeric finite-volume scheme with a gradient flow structure to simulate the multi-group dynamics, and implemented the scheme under both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases utilizing MATLAB.

### TEACHING EXPERIENCE

* __Teaching Assistant__, CMU Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering   

	_Sep. 2020 - present_
