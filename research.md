 My approach is based on using an extended data flow model for program decomposition and building an analytics framework on top of the program model to analyze the network cost (in terms of energy, compute, memory usage, and latency). The framework enables optimization at the system level by providing insights in managing computation and communication across the system; it also allows optimization at the application layer, where the developers can combine the application-specific knowledge with the feedback on the network cost to make design decisions.

I also have some experience designing low-power hardware for IoT applications, which gives me the sense of what's happening and how energy is consumed at the low level while  optimizing at the system level.
