My graduate research is about LPWA networks with a special focus on system-wide optimization. Advised by Bob Iannucci, I am part of the Computation and Communication Structures Group ([CCSG](http://ccsg.ece.cmu.edu/wp/)) in Carnegie Mellon University's Electrical and Computer Engineering department. As a group, we explore the hardware and software structures for information communication and processing. I am also part of the Learning, Incentives, and Optimization for Networked Systems ([LIONS](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html)) research group advised by Carlee Joe-Wong. We study networked systems and how to do optimization given different user objectives and interactions.

### Current research:
* [TickTalk Project](http://ccsg.ece.cmu.edu/wp/index.php/home/ticktalk/)

  **My contribution**: use an extended dataflow model to capture behaviors and operations of IoT applications, including communication, periodic sampling, etc. The model is further used to partition the program to run on a distributed system with optimized data communication.

* Intelligent Communications for Disaster Response
